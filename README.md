# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

A desktop-based **Operating System simulator** that visually demonstrates how different **CPU scheduling algorithms** work using **animated Gantt charts**. This project is designed for **academic learning** and **practical understanding** of core OS concepts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This simulator helps students understand how CPU scheduling decisions are made by the operating system. Users can select different scheduling algorithms, generate random processes, and observe **real-time animated execution**, including:

- Which process is currently running  
- How **preemption** occurs  
- How scheduling **metrics** are calculated  

The project was developed as part of the **Operating Systems course** for the **Department of Software Engineering, SMIU**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize CPU scheduling algorithms in an interactive way  
- Understand process execution, preemption, and context switching  
- Calculate and analyze scheduling metrics  
- Bridge the gap between **theoretical OS concepts** and **practical behavior**

## ⚙️ Implemented Scheduling Algorithms

### 🔹 First Come First Serve (FCFS)

### 🔹 Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Non-Preemptive  
- Preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First)

### 🔹 Priority Scheduling
- Non-Preemptive  
- Preemptive  

### 🔹 Round Robin (RR)
